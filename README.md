# Pong Game

Pong is a remake of the classic Atari Pong game in a more modern format. Instead of just the standard up and down movement of the paddles, we are now able to move the paddles left and right. There is also an additional ball to increase the difficulty of the players. Please feel free to have as much fun as possible with this game!
